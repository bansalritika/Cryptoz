<button class="accordion">What is Bitcoin?</button>
<div class="panels">
  <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that can be transferred on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.</p>
</div><br>

<button class="accordion">Who created Bitcoin?</button>
<div class="panels">
  <p>The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began use in 2009, when its implementation was released as open-source software.</p>
</div><br>

<button class="accordion">Who controls the Bitcoin network?</button>
<div class="panels">
  <p>Nobody owns the Bitcoin network much like no one owns the technology behind email. Bitcoin is controlled by all Bitcoin users around the world. While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use.</p>
</div><br>

<button class="accordion">How does Bitcoin work?</button>
<div class="panels">
  <p>Each Bitcoin is basically a computer file which is stored in a 'digital wallet' app on a smartphone or computer. People can send Bitcoins (or part of one) to your digital wallet, and you can send Bitcoins to other people. Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain.</p>
</div><br>

<button class="accordion">How does one acquire bitcoins?</button>
<div class="panels">
  <p>To buy Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency, you'll need a crypto exchange where buyers and sellers meet to exchange dollars for coins. There are scores of exchanges out there, but as a beginner, you'll want to opt for one that balances ease of use with low fees and high security</p>
